description: Build a production-ready image classification system using computer
  vision techniques
created_at: 2025-01-27T10:30:00.000Z
overview: >-
  Create a robust image classification system that can accurately categorize
  images into predefined classes.

  The system should handle real-world scenarios including varying image sizes,
  lighting conditions, and 

  different image formats. Focus on building a production-ready solution with
  proper error handling,

  validation, and extensibility.
requirements:
  core_features:
    - Image preprocessing pipeline (resize, normalize, format conversion)
    - Flexible image input handling, including direct byte streams
  nice_to_have:
    - Web interface for image upload and classification
    - Real-time classification via WebSocket
    - Model versioning and A/B testing support
    - Confidence scores and uncertainty quantification
    - Data augmentation during training
    - Model interpretability and visualization
  quality_standards:
    - All features must have comprehensive error handling
    - Code must be production-ready with proper logging
    - API responses must include appropriate HTTP status codes
    - Input validation for all user-provided data
    - Performance optimization for large image datasets
    - Security measures for file uploads and API access
constraints:
  technology_stack:
    - Python 3.8+
    - TensorFlow or PyTorch for deep learning
    - FastAPI or Flask for API development
    - OpenCV or PIL for image processing
    - NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation
  limitations:
    - Must support at least 3 image classes
    - Minimum 100 images per class for training
    - API response time under 2 seconds for single image
    - Support for common image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP)
    - "Maximum image size: 10MB per file"
  time_expectation: 4-6 hours
acceptance_criteria:
  - criteria: Image preprocessing pipeline supports direct byte stream input
    tests:
      - Can preprocess valid image data provided as bytes (e.g., JPEG, PNG)
      - Handles errors gracefully for invalid or malformed byte streams
      - Output of byte stream preprocessing matches file-based preprocessing for
        identical image content

  When implementing this challenge:

  1. FOCUS ON QUALITY OVER QUANTITY
     - Write production-ready code, not quick hacks
     - Include proper error handling and validation
     - Make it easy for humans to review and understand

  2. DOCUMENTATION MATTERS
     - Explain complex logic with comments
     - Document setup steps in README
     - Note any assumptions or trade-offs made

  3. COLLABORATION MINDSET
     - Write code as if you're joining an existing team
     - Follow common conventions and best practices
     - Make it easy for others to modify and extend

  4. STAY ON TRACK
     - Follow the requirements and acceptance criteria defined above
     - Don't add features outside the scope without explicit approval
     - Ask for clarification if requirements are ambiguous
